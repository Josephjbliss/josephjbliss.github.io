# Scenario
Wanderlust Photography is a NYC-based Photography studio. You have been hired as their in-house Front-End Developer, working in tandem with a Visual Designer and Back-End / Javascript Developer.

### The Problem

Gone are the days of the Wanderlust Photography single-page lander. To provide more information about the business, you are adding an "About Us" page that shows what services they offer, as well as outlines some of the Artist's vision.

![Layout](assets/layout.jpg)

### What to Code

Add additional markup to about.html where indicated: 

    <!-- ************************* -->
    <!-- Add Markup Here -->
    <!-- ************************* -->

and styles to css/style.css where indicated:

    /*******************************/
    /* Add Styles Here */
    /*******************************/

to match the provided Design.

All necessary text on the page can be found in assets/about.txt.

All necessary images can be found in images/

Annotated Design mockups are provided for you and will outline all of the styles on the page necessary to complete the task. Annotated Design mockups can be found in mockups/ and include:

- about-us-400.png
- about-us-600.png
- about-us-960.png
- about-us-1280.png

Strive for pixel perfection.

When you've finished, zip ONLY about.html and style.css together and upload as solution.zip.

### Grading:

Your code will be graded based on:

- Function: how closely you match the provided Design.
- Efficiency: its maintainability and run time.
- Consistency: whether it is written consistently with the rest of the code base. Specifically:
  * Use only lowercase characters (for elements, attributes, selectors, properties, etc.)
  * HTML
    * Begin block objects on their own line.
    * Do not skip lines.
    * Indent child elements (two spaces).
    * Use double quotation marks - "
  * CSS
    * Separate words in ID and Class names by a hyphen
    * Indent declarations, as well as rules within media queries (two spaces).
    * Use single quotation marks - '
    * Semicolons: always use.
    * Separate rules by new lines.
  * If you're unsure about a particular situation, refer to the Google HTML/CSS Style Guide at [https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml)

### The Problem

Business is booming! Wanderlust has opened spaces in several NYC neighborhoods where they sell prints and photography services. Now that they are a brick-and-mortar - as well as eCommerce - shop, they need to allow users to find their stores. You work with a hard-core Javascript developer who created a Google Map with pins that should pop-up a modal view with more information about each of the following studio locations:

- Long Island City
- Greenpoint
- Clinton Hill
- Nolita

New Yorkers are on-the-go, but the mobile navigation menu doesn't work yet. Currently, you just have the nav collapsing into a navicon.

### What to Code - Google Map

Add necessary styles to css/style.css where indicated:

    /*******************************/
    /* Add Styles Here */
    /*******************************/

to match the provided Design. NOTE: You MUST change the default #overlay-wrapper { } style.

All of the HTML is being dynamically provided for you. When the user clicks-on a pin, the #overlay-wrapper will be populated accordingly. (Use your Developer Tools to see the structure of the DOM to style).

Annotated Design mockups are provided for you and will outline all of the styles on the page necessary to complete the task. Annotated Design mockups can be found in mockups/ and include:

- locations-400-a.png
- locations-400-b.png
- locations-1280.png

Strive for pixel perfection.

### What to Code - Mobile Navigation

Add necessary styles to css/style.css where indicated:

    /*******************************/
    /* Add Styles Here */
    /*******************************/

to match the provided Design.

Add necessary styles to css/style.css to style the modal according to page 3 of the Design PDF. Similarly, all of the functionality of the mobile nav has been provided for you. (Again, your Developer tools will help you here).

![Mobile Nav](assets/mobilenav.gif)

Hint: The JS provided toggles the class "open" on the nav and toggles the class "fa-bars" and "fa-close" on the #mobile icon, thereby switching between an "x" and a hamburger icon.

An annotated Design mockup is provided for you andcan be found in mockups/mobile-nav-400.png
